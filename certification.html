            <h4 class="font-weight-bold mt-4">Course Completion</h4>
            <p>MOOCs have grown in number and popularity but failed to live up to its mission of democratizing education around the world. Out of the <strong>290948</strong> students who registered for the HarvardX open courseware 
                in 2012 and 2013, only <strong>65,261</strong> completed the courseware representing <strong>22.4%</strong> of total student enrollnments. Out of the 65,261 who completed the courseware only 
                <strong>5728</strong> received certifications, distressingly representing <strong>2%</strong> of total student enrollnments.</p>

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Certification</h4>
                <p>Certification rate in general is disappointingly low but we want to see if this is true for all demographics in this dataset.
                We will analyze individual courses, student age, level of education as well as the country of origin to perhaps diagnose the problem of low completion and low certification.
                First, out of <strong>143,266</strong> students who registered for Introduction to Computer Science, only <strong>1%</strong> were certified. 
                Out of <strong>49,293</strong> students who registered for Justice, <strong>4%</strong> were certified. Out of <strong>37709</strong> students who registered for 
                Health in numbers, <strong>5%</strong> were certified. Out of the <strong>35509</strong> students who registered for Human health and global environmental change, <strong>2%</strong> were certified. 
                Out of the <strong>25171</strong> students who registered for the Ancient Greek hero, only <strong>1%</strong> received certifications.</p>

                <div class="column">
            <img src="./css/relative_course_certification.jpg" alt="Course Registration by gender" style="width:100%">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Secondly, about 73% of the students who completed the courseware and received certification already have a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree(s).
This shows that students accessing the courseware regard it merely as a resource to fill in gaps to suplement skills already learnt in a four
year traditional institution. Additionally about 67% of those who recieved certifications fall within ages 16 to 30 which is the targeted age group, the 
only problem is that there are simple not enough certifications for students within this age group compared to the number of enrollments. </p>

<p>8 out of the top 9 countries by certification are from Europe with the exception of one country from South Asia which is India.The top 9 countries
    make up 45% of all certifications from the HarvardX open courseware. </p>
