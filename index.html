                <p> Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free online courses open for everyone to enroll. MOOCs are attractive in that it levels the 
                    playing field and provides opportunities for students from different walks of life and from different countries to study "together" at the 
                    comfort of their own homes and this is facilitated by leading professors from renowed univeristies at little to no cost. It was sold as an on-demand 
                    online education to accomodate conflicting family and work responsibilties which offer students the flexibility to study and do life. Schools like University of Maryland 
                    University College were among the first univeristies to accept MOOCs for credit, since then more institutions have welcomed the idea of 
                    providing online education for free. MOOCs sadly have simply not lived up to their mission to transform the educational system around the 
                    world and once again we see how a good free initiative fails.<br><br>
                    Inspite of the popularity of MOOCs, employers do not regard certifications from MOOCs as valid credentials neither as an alternative to traditional educational insitutions,
                    in essence, it is pretty useless unless you already possess a degree from an accredited traditional educational insitution.We will analyze the first 
                    two years of Harvard's attempt at offering open and free courses to all, we will look at its successes, failures and the way forward.

                <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize">Data Source</h3>
                <p>The dataset used in this study was obtained from Harvard University's Dataverse website. This dataset includes the De-Identified HarvardX Person-Course information on 
                    the edX platform for the Academic Year 2012 and 2013. The initial two years on edX Harvard presented five courses only; Introduction to Computer Science,
                Justice, Health in numbers, Human Health and Global Environmental Change and The Ancient Greek Hero. For dataset, please click this link. <br>
               <cite>The original datatset had to be deidentified by a research team in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which protects the privacy of student records.</cite><br>
                Variables in the dataset are either administrative indicating they come from the edX system or user-provided indicating that they come from questions
               asked by edX of the student at the time of registration</p>

                <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize ">Registration</h3>
                <h5>Course title and Gender</h5>
                <p>Out of the <strong>290,498</strong> registrations, <strong>49.2%</strong> of the students registered for Introduction to Computer Science, <strong>16.9%</strong> for Justice, 
                <strong>13% </strong> for Health in numbers, <strong>12.2%</strong> for Human Health and Global environmental change and finally <strong>8.7%</strong> registered for the Ancient Greek Hero.
                 When we break this down by gender, males outnumber females in overall regsitration by <strong>106,149</strong>. Analyzing individual course registration, males still outnumber females.
                 we see this in all the courses listed and even more significantly in the Computer science subject.<br>

<h5>Level of education, Country and Age </h5>
    The goal of MOOCs is to make world class education accessible to all persons including students from developing countries.We do see however that the 
        United States leads the pack (which is a developed country) instead of the targeted countries from the global south.
    <strong>78.8%</strong> of students who registered for the courseware were between ages <strong>16 and 34</strong>, we can be reasonably confident and say that most of the students are either millenials or generation z.
<strong>68%</strong> of the students who registered for the courseware already possess either a bachelor's, master's or a doctorate degree(s)</p>
