### Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free online courses open for everyone to enroll. MOOCs are attractive because they attempt to level the playing field and provide opportunities for students from all walks of life and from different countries to study "together" at the comfort of their own homes and this is facilitated by leading professors from renowned universities at little to no cost to students. It was sold as an on-demand online education to accommodate conflicting family and work responsibilities which offer students the flexibility to study and do life. Schools like University of Maryland University College were among the first universities to accept MOOCs for credit, since then more institutions have welcomed the idea of providing online education for free. MOOCs sadly have simply not lived up to their mission to transform the educational system around the world and once again we see how a good free initiative fails.

Despite the popularity of MOOCs, employers do not regard certifications from MOOCs as valid credentials neither as an alternative to traditional educational institutions, in essence, it is useless unless you already possess a degree from an accredited traditional educational institution. We will analyze the first two years of Harvard's attempt at offering open and free courses to all, we will look at its successes, failures, and the way forward.
