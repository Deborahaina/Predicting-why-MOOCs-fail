            <p>What can Harvardx do to improve completion rate and consequently improve certification rate? Administratively, we can analyze the courses and see if 
               there is anyway to improve student engagement. Finding the sweet spot, that is the optimal number of course chapters that will result in more certifications.
               From the chart(Course chapter vs number of certifications) we see that the curve begins an ascend at 11 chapters until it reaches its most impactful number of chapter(s)
               which is 12. Courses should be structured to run between 11 to 13 chapters, not too short and no too long for the desired outcome.Courses that run longer than 13 chapters
               can be subdivided to run as two separate courses.
               From the second chart(Interactive days vs number of certifications), the most impactful number of unique days with the course was
               from about weeks 2 to weeks 8, making up about 73% of all certifications.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
            <p>Getting students to access 50% or more of the courseware is the goal here, simply because having invested that much time and having shown 
                that much interest, most students will stay through till the end of the course. We see that from the chart that 5256 out of the 5728 course certifications 
                came from students who accessed 50% or more of the courseware. <br> In case you are wondering that is about 92% of all certifications. 
                Structuring course chapters to correspond with the desired number of days students are willing to invest will increase student engagement.
                This has to be done without sacrificing quality.

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Predictions</h4>
            <p>Using a binary logistic regression algorithm, we predict the likelihood of a student being certified or not certified in the HarvardX open courseware. This model
                performed extremely well with a 98.7% accuracy, 73% precision and 60.6% recall. Using 30% of the data as test data which is 87285 rows of data, there are 
                85184 True negatives, 383 False negatives, 1042 True positives and 676 False positives. We can see from this that sadly, a large number of students who 
                register for the HarvardX courseware will not receive certifications. </p>

            <h4>Conclusions</h4>
            <p>We can agree that MOOCs began conceptually as a great idea but fails in implementation, the simple truth is that attitudes towards initiatives labelled 'free'
                in certain parts of the world encourage apathy. We see that in almost countries from every continent except for Europe. Secondly, some students
                need external discipline to stay committed and complete the course but because there is nothing to lose and the stakes are low, most students simply
                to do see the reason to do so. Thirdly, a large number of those who registered for these courses as well as those who received certifications were from developed countries. </p>
